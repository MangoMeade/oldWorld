# oldWorld

Old World is a web application that maps a picture to the place where it was taken. The idea behind Old World is to create a mosaic of pictures that show how an area looked at a particular point in time. 

# How to use
To see a map with the pictures go to the "Map" tab. A menu allows you filter pictures by decade. ej: 1901-1910, 1931-1940, etc.

To upload a picture go to the "Add Photo" tab. Go to the place where the picture was taken and click on the specific location. After all fields are uploaded click "Submit".
